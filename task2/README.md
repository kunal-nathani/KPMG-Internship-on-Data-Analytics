## Targeting high value customers based on customer demographics and attributes

### Background Information

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd has updateda new list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics and attributes. However, these customers do not have prior transaction history with the organisation. 

The marketing team at Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is sure that, if correctly analysed, the data would reveal useful customer insights which could help optimise resource allocation for targeted marketing. Hence, improve performance by focusing on high value customers.

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is a long-standing client who specialises in high-quality bikes and accessible cycling accessories to riders. Their marketing team is looking to boost business by analysing their existing customer dataset to determine customer trends and behaviour.

### Task

-  To analyse and recommend which of these 1000 new customers should be targeted to drive the most value for the organisation, using the existing 3 datasets (Customer demographic, customer address and transactions). 

- To build this recommendation, start with a PowerPoint presentation which outlines the approach which we will be taking. The client has agreed on a 3 week scope with the following 3 phases as follows - Data Exploration; Model Development; Interpretation.

- To prepare a detailed approach for completing the analysis including activities â€“ i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting.
