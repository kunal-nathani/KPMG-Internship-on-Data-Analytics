# Data Insights and Presentation
## Using visualisations to present insights

### Background Information
The client is happy with the analysis plan and would like us to proceed.  After building the model we need to present our results back to the client. 

Visualisations such as interactive dashboards often help us highlight key findings and convey our ideas in a more succinct manner. A list of customers or algorithm won’t cut it with the client, we need to support our results with the use of visualisations. 

-----

### Task
1. To develop a dashboard that we can present to the client at our next meeting. 

2. To display the data summary and results of the analysis in a dashboard ( using Tableau or Microsoft BI). 

3. To deliver a maximum of 3 dashboard views/tabs, with creativity in the layout and presentation. 

Some important things to be kept in mind in business context during presention of findings:

- What are the trends in the underlying data?

- Which customer segment has the highest customer value?

- What do you propose should be Sprocket Central Pty Ltd ’s marketing and growth strategy?

- What additional external datasets may be useful to obtain greater insights into customer preferences and propensity to purchase the products?
